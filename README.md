# Pomodoro Clock

Pomodoro clock project created with React.

To use, set the work and break times to whatever you prefer, then click the clock display to pause/unpause. When the timer gets to 0 it will pause to allow time to finish whatever you are doing; then, when ready, click the clock again to continue.
